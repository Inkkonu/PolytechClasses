# C++ (Semester 7)

Here you can find practical works for the class of C++ from the 7th semester.

Unfortunately, I do not have the practical work subjects anymore.

The practical works have not been reworked, they have simply been reformatted, so there might be some errors.

Be careful, most of this code is either good or bad, I'm not an expert in C++ so I can't tell.

My grade for this class : 16/20
