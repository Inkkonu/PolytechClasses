# C (Semester 6)

Here you can find practice and graded practical works for the class of C from the 6th semester.

Unfortunately, I do not have the practical work subjects anymore.

Also, the practice practical works have been slightly reworked to be more readable and understandable but the graded ones are as I submitted them.

Be careful though, most of this code is pretty bad (:

My grade for this class : 12.5/20 (but I coded on Vi for the exam, I should have had more :COPIUM:)
