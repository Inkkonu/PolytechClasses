# Java (Semester 6)

Here you can find practical works for the class of Java from the 6th semester.

Unfortunately, I do not have the practical work subjects anymore.

Also, the practical works have been slightly reworked to be more readable and understandable.

Be careful though, most of this code is pretty bad (:

My grade for this class : 14.46/20
