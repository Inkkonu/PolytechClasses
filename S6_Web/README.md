# Web (Semester 6)

Here you can find practical works for the class of Web development from the 6th semester.

Unfortunately, I do not have the practical work subjects anymore.

The practical works have not been reworked to be more readable and understandable because I hate web development (and especially JavaScript, this language should not exist). They have simply been reformatted.

Be careful, most of this code is extremely bad (:

My grade for this class : 13.554/20
