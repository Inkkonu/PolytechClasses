# Polytech Classes

This repo is made to have all of the practical works and projects that I've worked on at Polytech' Nantes instead of every class having its own repo.

Further details about each class can be found in the corresponding README.

You may use everything you find on this repo at your own risk although pretty much everything here is useless unless you're a student at Polytech :)
